 * Server-derived tenant context (SaaS Master Plan §9; decision D6,
 * docs/saas/DECISIONS.md, resolved 2026-09-07 — BOTH host/subdomain and
 * `X-Active-Tenant` header, header cross-validated against the caller's
 * `ACTIVE` `TenantMembership` rows).
 *
 * `TenantContextGuard` is the ONLY place that constructs this for the
 * ordinary membership path. Nothing else should ever read `X-Active-Tenant`
 * (or any client-supplied identifier) directly and treat it as
 * authoritative — see that guard's own header comment.
 *
 * Phase 5 W6 (decision P5-D8): `'support-session'` is the second, entirely
 * separate producer — `common/tenant/support-session-context.guard.ts`,
 * which runs BEFORE `TenantContextGuard` and, once it resolves a valid
 * SupportSession, makes `TenantContextGuard` skip its own resolution
 * entirely (see that guard's own header comment on why the header/domain/
 * membership-default logic must never run afterward and silently override
 * or reject a session-derived context). A `'support-session'` context
 * never carries `membership` (there is no real `TenantMembership` — the
 * actor is a platform admin, not a tenant member) and instead carries
 * `supportSession`.
